    This App has been made as my very first complete app and it works as a portfolio  

    The main idea is to have an enviroment for studying with the Pomodoro tecnique. 

    Study blocks of 25 minutes and breaks of 5 minutes, trying to do a minimalistic but non bugged site to be fully concentrated as much as possible. 
    As I develop the app we'll see that it is basic but it holds it's purpose entirely. 


    The technologies I use here are React (Vite), and CSS( Tailwind, daysiUI ). 

    I'll try to make it easy to understand for whomever wants to work on the code, and to implement some new tools little by little
